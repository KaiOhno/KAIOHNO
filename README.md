# Kai Ohno

Full-stack mobile developer focused on building and shipping real-world, production-ready applications.

I design and build data-driven mobile products end to end — from frontend UX to backend services, data pipelines, and performance optimization. My work emphasizes reliability, scalability, and clean system architecture.

## Featured Project — Deal Dish

**Deal Dish** is a production iOS application I designed, built, and shipped as a solo developer.

The app helps users plan meals around **weekly grocery deals**, combining real-world product data with applied recipe generation logic to reduce food costs and food waste.

### What I built
- React Native (Expo) iOS application
- Backend services for ingesting and processing weekly grocery data
- Recipe generation logic driven by structured product data
- Firebase / Firestore data modeling and access patterns
- Caching and batching strategies to reduce database reads and improve performance
- Subscription-based monetization (auto-renewable subscriptions)

This project represents full ownership of the system — frontend, backend, data flow, and deployment.
